Don't use master.
Make a new feature from the latest develop.
When finished, make a pull request from "Repo -> Your feature" to "Repo -> Develop"
When everything is fine and dandy the files in your feature will get merged in the 'Develop' branch.
Then you can pull the 'Develop' branch in Gitkraken for the latest working code
